While Botium Toys has a decent security posture in the physical realm, both of its administrative and technical security controls could use a lot of work. 
Most importantly, regulations for SOC (Tpe 1 & 2), GDPR, and PCI DSS are not currently met. To remedy this, Botium Toys should first use the principle of least privilege to ensure that not everyone in the company has access to customer SPII. Additionally, customer payment data should be encrypted to be kept further out of reach of threat actors. Established user access policies and separation of duties would round out meeting SOC and PCI DSS requirements. To meet the rest of GDPR requirements, there needs to be a schedule and process for classification and data inventory, especially when it comes to Botium Toys’ legacy systems. 
These changes would keep Botium Toys up to all relevant compliance standards, but further recommendations to protect the company include establishing a disaster recovery plan, establishing secure data backups, a centralized password management system to help with business continuity, and installing an Intruder Detection System (IDS)
